It's a very simple address book to demonstrate and practice some coding skills.

When you click on a contact's name, his whole set of information will appear.


### Setup:

* _Clone directory from "https://github.com/DillonLloydLee/Address_Book_2.git"_

* _To run tests, open the spec-runner.html file in the spec folder._
* _That's it!  Run this program from the page and follow onscreen directions._
